🎯 Phishing Attack Simulation – Credential Harvester
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a phishing attack simulation using the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) on Kali Linux. The objective was to assess employee awareness of phishing threats by deploying cloned login pages to capture credential inputs in a controlled environment.

🛠️ Tools & Environment
OS: Kali Linux

Toolkit: Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)

Attack Vector: Credential Harvester (Web Attack Method)

Server: Local Apache server (hosted phishing pages)

IP: Localhost (customized for simulation)

🚀 Methodology
Cloned target login pages using SET.

Hosted pages on a local Apache server.

Captured POST data (usernames & passwords) submitted via phishing forms.

Analyzed user interaction and response behavior.

📊 Results
Credentials were successfully harvested from test users.

Sample:
Username: joe
Password: password123

⚠️ Challenges
Difficulties cloning dynamic sites (e.g., Instagram, Microsoft).
Apache port conflicts.
Mixed levels of user awareness.

✅ Recommendations
Implement regular phishing awareness training.

Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Conduct periodic phishing simulations.

Enhance email filtering and endpoint protection.

🧠 Conclusion
The simulation highlighted security awareness gaps and reinforced the need for continuous training and layered security protocols to combat phishing threats.
